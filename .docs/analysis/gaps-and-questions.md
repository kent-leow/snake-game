## Clarifying Questions

### Core Gameplay Questions
1. **Combo System Behavior**:
   - What happens to combo progress when the snake dies?
   - Should combo progress be displayed visually to the player?
   - Can combos be extended beyond 5 blocks (e.g., 1-5, then 1-5 again)?

2. **Game Difficulty**:
   - What is the maximum speed the snake should reach?
   - Should there be different difficulty levels?
   - How should the game handle very long snakes (performance considerations)?

3. **Game Board**:
   - What should be the game board dimensions (e.g., 20x20, 30x30 grid)?
   - Should the game board be resizable based on screen size?
   - Are there any visual indicators for the game boundaries?

### User Experience Questions
4. **Controls**:
   - Should the game support both arrow keys and WASD controls?
   - Do you want mobile touch controls (swipe gestures)?
   - Should there be pause/resume functionality?

5. **Visual Design**:
   - Do you have preferences for color schemes or visual themes?
   - Should the snake have a specific visual style (classic blocks, modern rounded, etc.)?
   - How should food blocks display their numbers (overlay, color-coding, etc.)?

6. **High Score System**:
   - How many high scores should be stored (top 10, top 5, etc.)?
   - Should high scores include player names/initials?
   - Do you want date/time stamps for high scores?

### Technical Questions
7. **Browser Support**:
   - What is the minimum browser version you want to support?
   - Is Internet Explorer support required?
   - Should the game work on mobile browsers?

8. **Audio Requirements**:
   - Do you have specific music tracks in mind, or should placeholder music be used?
   - What audio file formats are preferred (MP3, OGG, WAV)?
   - Should audio be optional (mute toggle)?

9. **Settings Configuration**:
   - What specific settings should be configurable (volume, controls, difficulty)?
   - Should settings persist across browser sessions?
   - Do you want keyboard shortcut customization?

### Development Process Questions
10. **Framework and Technology**:
    - Do you have a preference for JavaScript framework (React, Vue, vanilla JS)?
    - Should the game use a game engine (Phaser, PixiJS) or be built from scratch?
    - Are there any specific libraries you want to avoid or prefer?

11. **Performance and Optimization**:
    - What devices should the game run smoothly on (minimum specs)?
    - Should there be performance optimization options for lower-end devices?
    - How important is the total bundle size?

12. **Future Enhancements**:
    - Are there plans for multiplayer features in the future?
    - Should the architecture support additional game modes?
    - Do you want analytics/telemetry for gameplay data?

## Risk Assessment for Gaps

### High Priority Gaps (Require immediate clarification)
- Game board dimensions and boundaries
- Framework choice for implementation
- Collision detection specifications

### Medium Priority Gaps (Should be clarified before development starts)
- Combo system reset behavior
- Mobile device support requirements
- Maximum speed limits
- Audio licensing considerations

### Low Priority Gaps (Can be decided during development)
- Visual design details
- Audio file formats
- Specific UI control layouts
- Asset optimization standards

## Recommendations for Gap Resolution

1. **Create technical spike** for framework evaluation
2. **Design mockups** for visual clarification
3. **Prototype core mechanics** to validate game feel
4. **Test browser compatibility** early in development
5. **Plan audio asset sourcing** strategy (royalty-free vs. custom)
