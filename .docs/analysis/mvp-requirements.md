## MVP Technical Stack Recommendations

### Recommended Approach
- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript (React-based framework optimized for Vercel)
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM and TypeScript interfaces
- **Local Development**: Docker Compose for MongoDB container
- **Graphics**: HTML5 Canvas API (within React components with TypeScript)
- **Storage**: MongoDB for persistent data + localStorage for caching
- **Deployment**: Next.js app to Vercel with MongoDB Atlas
- **Development**: Modern React with full TypeScript support and strict type checking

## MVP User Stories

### Essential User Journeys
1. **First-time Player**:
   - Visit main menu
   - Start new game
   - Learn controls through play
   - Experience combo mechanics
   - See score and game over
   - View high score

2. **Returning Player**:
   - Access game quickly
   - Beat previous high score
   - Experience improved combo strategy
   - See persistent high scores

### MVP Acceptance Criteria

#### Core Gameplay
- [ ] Snake moves smoothly in 4 directions (arrow keys)
- [ ] Snake grows by 1 segment when eating food
- [ ] Game ends when snake hits walls or itself
- [ ] 5 food blocks visible at all times with numbers 1-5
- [ ] Eating in sequence (1→2→3→4→5) grants combo bonus
- [ ] Eating out of sequence breaks combo and resets speed
- [ ] Speed increases noticeably after each combo
- [ ] Score displays current points (base + combo bonuses)

#### User Interface
- [ ] Main menu with "Start Game" and "High Scores" buttons
- [ ] Game page shows current score, high score, and game area
- [ ] High score page displays top scores with navigation back
- [ ] Game over shows final score and restart option
- [ ] All pages load within 3 seconds

#### Data Persistence
- [ ] High scores persist in MongoDB database
- [ ] Local development uses Docker MongoDB container
- [ ] Production uses MongoDB Atlas
- [ ] Top 10 scores stored with player names and timestamps
- [ ] Scores display correctly formatted numbers
- [ ] API endpoints handle score CRUD operations
- [ ] Database connection pooling for performance

## MVP Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- Game runs without crashes for 10+ minute sessions
- All combo mechanics work as specified
- Scores save and load correctly from MongoDB
- Page navigation functions properly
- TypeScript compilation without errors

### Performance Metrics
- Game maintains 30+ FPS on standard hardware
- Page load times under 3 seconds
- No memory leaks during extended play
- Responsive controls (< 100ms input lag)
- Database operations complete within 500ms

## Post-MVP Roadmap

### Version 1.1 (Audio & Polish)
- Background music and sound effects
- Enhanced animations and visual effects
- Settings page with audio controls
- Improved visual design

### Version 1.2 (Mobile & Features)
- Mobile touch controls
- Responsive design for mobile
- Additional difficulty levels
- Snake length progression (100pts rule)

### Version 1.3 (Advanced Features)
- Game state saving/loading
- Multiple high score categories
- Advanced visual themes
- Performance optimizations

## Development Approach for MVP

1. **Week 1**: Setup Next.js with TypeScript, Docker MongoDB, and basic snake mechanics
2. **Week 2**: Combo system implementation, MongoDB integration with TypeScript interfaces, and API development
3. **Week 3**: UI components, manual validation, and deployment to Vercel with MongoDB Atlas

**Priority Order**:
1. Next.js with TypeScript project setup and Docker MongoDB configuration
2. TypeScript interfaces and type definitions for game objects
3. Basic snake movement and collision (React Canvas component with types)
4. Food system with numbering and proper TypeScript models
5. Combo logic implementation with type safety
6. MongoDB schema with TypeScript interfaces and API routes
7. UI pages and navigation (Next.js routing with TypeScript)
8. Database integration and high score persistence
9. Manual validation and bug fixes
10. Deployment to Vercel with MongoDB Atlas connection
