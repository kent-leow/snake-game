## Implementation Overview

### New Files Created

1. **`src/lib/game/multipleFoodTypes.ts`**

   - Configuration types for the multiple food system
   - Default configuration with colors and values

2. **`src/lib/game/MultipleFoodManager.ts`**
   - Core manager class for handling 5 numbered food blocks
   - Intelligent spawning logic that avoids overlaps
   - Food consumption and replacement system
   - State validation and statistics

3. **`src/lib/game/NumberedFoodRenderer.ts`**
   - Specialized renderer for numbered food blocks
   - Animation support with pulsing effects
   - Configurable styling and text rendering
   - Efficient batch rendering for multiple foods

### Modified Files

1. **`src/lib/game/collisionDetection.ts`**
   - Added methods for multiple food collision detection
   - Support for checking positions against arrays of numbered foods
   - Batch collision detection for performance

2. **`src/lib/game/gameEngine.ts`**
   - Integrated MultipleFoodManager alongside existing FoodManager
   - Added mode switching between single and multiple food systems
   - Updated game state to include multiple food data
   - Enhanced callbacks for multiple food consumption

3. **`src/lib/rendering/CanvasRenderer.ts`**
   - Updated GameElements interface to support multiple foods
   - Added rendering support for numbered food blocks
   - Conditional rendering based on food mode

4. **`src/components/game/GameCanvas.tsx`**
   - Updated to pass multiple food data to renderer
   - Support for both single and multiple food modes

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

All acceptance criteria have been successfully validated through automated tests:

### ✅ AC1: Game Initialization
**GIVEN** game starts **WHEN** board initializes **THEN** exactly 5 food blocks appear with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

- ✓ Exactly 5 foods are created
- ✓ Foods are numbered 1-5
- ✓ All foods have unique positions
- ✓ Each food has appropriate color and value

### ✅ AC2: Food Consumption and Replacement
**GIVEN** food block consumed **WHEN** eaten by snake **THEN** new food block appears with the same number at different location

- ✓ Consumed food is properly tracked
- ✓ Replacement food has the same number
- ✓ Replacement appears at different location
- ✓ Total count remains at 5 foods

### ✅ AC3: Snake Collision Avoidance
**GIVEN** food blocks **WHEN** spawning **THEN** none appear on snake body segments

- ✓ Foods never spawn on snake head
- ✓ Foods never spawn on snake body segments
- ✓ Validated with large snake configurations

### ✅ AC4: Food Overlap Prevention
**GIVEN** food blocks **WHEN** spawning **THEN** none overlap with other food blocks

- ✓ All food positions are unique
- ✓ No overlapping foods detected
- ✓ Maintained during consumption cycles

## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Architecture

```typescript
interface NumberedFood {
  id: string;
  number: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;
  position: Position;
  color: string;
  timestamp: number;
  value: number;
}

class MultipleFoodManager {
  private foods: Map<number, NumberedFood>;
  
  public initializeFoods(snakePositions: Position[]): void;
  public consumeFood(number: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5, snakePositions: Position[]): FoodConsumptionResult | null;
  public getFoods(): NumberedFood[];
  public validateState(): ValidationResult;
}
```

### Performance Optimizations

- **Efficient Position Generation**: Smart random positioning with fallback algorithms
- **Collision Detection**: O(n) collision checks for multiple food blocks
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and state management
- **Rendering**: Batch rendering for all food blocks with animation support

### Error Handling

- **Fallback Positioning**: When random placement fails, systematic grid search
- **State Validation**: Comprehensive validation of food system state
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues working even in edge cases
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with strict typing

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests (26 tests)
- ✅ MultipleFoodManager: Initialization, consumption, validation
- ✅ NumberedFoodRenderer: Rendering, animation, configuration
- ✅ CollisionDetector: Multiple food collision detection

### Integration Tests (13 tests)
- ✅ GameEngine integration with multiple food mode
- ✅ State management and mode switching
- ✅ Callback system integration

### Acceptance Tests (7 tests)
- ✅ All GIVEN/WHEN/THEN scenarios validated
- ✅ System lifecycle testing
- ✅ Edge case validation

**Total Test Coverage**: 46 automated tests, all passing

## API Documentation

### GameEngine Integration

```typescript
// Enable multiple food mode
gameEngine.enableMultipleFood();

// Check current mode
const isMultipleMode = gameEngine.isMultipleFoodEnabled();

// Get all numbered foods
const foods = gameEngine.getMultipleFoods();

// Get statistics
const stats = gameEngine.getMultipleFoodStats();

// Validate system state
const validation = gameEngine.validateMultipleFoodState();
```

### Configuration

```typescript
const config: MultipleFoodConfig = {
  gridSize: 20,
  boardWidth: 800,
  boardHeight: 600,
  colors: {
    food1: '#FF6B6B',  // Red
    food2: '#4ECDC4',  // Teal
    food3: '#45B7D1',  // Blue
    food4: '#FFA07A',  // Light Salmon
    food5: '#98D8C8',  // Mint
  },
  values: {
    food1: 10,
    food2: 20,
    food3: 30,
    food4: 40,
    food5: 50,
  },
};
```
