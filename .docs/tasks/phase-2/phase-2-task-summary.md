## Task Dependencies

### Critical Path
```
Phase 1 Foundation
    ↓
T-2.1.1 (Multiple Food System) 
    ↓
T-2.2.1 (Combo State) → T-2.3.1 (Speed System) → T-2.4.1 (DB Schema)
    ↓                      ↓                        ↓
T-2.2.2 (Combo UI)    → T-2.3.2 (Speed UI)   → T-2.4.2 (Score API)
    ↓                                              ↓
T-2.2.3 (Score Integration)                   → T-2.4.3 (Client Score)
```

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- T-2.1.2 can develop alongside T-2.1.1 
- T-2.4.1 can begin independently of other tasks
- UI tasks (T-2.2.2, T-2.3.2) can develop in parallel once backend is ready

## Resource Allocation

### Backend Development (5 tasks)
- **Total Effort**: 19-26 hours
- **Critical Tasks**: T-2.2.1 (Combo State), T-2.4.2 (Score API)
- **Foundation Tasks**: T-2.1.1 (Food System), T-2.4.1 (DB Schema)

### Frontend Development (3 tasks)  
- **Total Effort**: 9-12 hours
- **UI/UX Focus**: Visual feedback and user experience
- **Integration Points**: Game state and API connectivity

### Database Development (1 task)
- **Total Effort**: 3-4 hours  
- **Focus**: Schema design and performance optimization

## Technical Risks & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Combo State Management Complexity**
   - Risk: State machine bugs causing incorrect combo tracking
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive unit tests and state validation

2. **Performance with Multiple Food Blocks**
   - Risk: Frame rate degradation with increased collision detection
   - Mitigation: Efficient spatial partitioning and performance monitoring

3. **Database Connection Reliability**
   - Risk: MongoDB Atlas connection issues
   - Mitigation: Local storage fallback and retry logic

### Medium-Risk Areas
1. **Speed Progression Balance**
   - Risk: Game becoming unplayable at high speeds
   - Mitigation: Extensive playtesting and configurable limits

2. **Score Validation Security**
