## Task Dependencies

### Dependency Chain

```
US-5.1.1 (Touch Events) → US-5.1.3 (Touch Integration)
US-5.1.2 (Mobile UI) → US-5.1.3 (Touch Integration)
US-5.2.1 (Settings UI) → US-5.2.2 (Settings Integration)
```

### External Dependencies

- Phase 4 Audio System (US-4.1, US-4.2) for audio settings
- Phase 1 Game Controls (US-1.6) for control integration
- Phase 1 Canvas Rendering (US-1.7) for mobile optimization

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

- US-5.1.1 and US-5.1.2 can be developed in parallel
- US-5.2.1 can be developed alongside mobile UI work
- Settings integration (US-5.2.2) can begin once mobile touch is complete

## Critical Path

1. **US-5.1.1** - Touch Event System and Gesture Detection (mobile input foundation)
2. **US-5.1.2** - Mobile-Responsive UI Layout (mobile interface)
3. **US-5.1.3** - Touch Controls Integration (mobile gameplay)
4. **US-5.2.1** - Settings Page UI and Components (settings interface)
5. **US-5.2.2** - Settings Integration and Persistence (complete customization)

## Risk Assessment

### Medium Risk Tasks

- **5.1.1** (Touch Event System) - Cross-platform touch behavior differences
- **5.1.2** (Mobile UI Layout) - Complex responsive design requirements
- **5.2.2** (Settings Integration) - Integration with existing audio and control systems

### Low Risk Tasks

- **5.1.3** (Touch Integration) - Straightforward integration once foundation is built
- **5.2.1** (Settings UI) - Standard form component development

## Technical Challenges

### Mobile Touch Implementation
