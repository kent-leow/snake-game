# Phase 1 Testing Strategy

## Overview
Comprehensive testing strategy for Phase 1 implementation focusing on manual validation, performance testing, and user experience validation for the Snake Game MVP foundation.

## Testing Approach

### Testing Philosophy
- **Manual validation-first**: Given the personal project nature, emphasis on thorough manual testing
- **Critical path coverage**: Focus testing on core gameplay mechanics and user flows  
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Ensure consistent experience across major browsers
- **Device compatibility**: Validate performance and usability on various devices
- **Performance-driven**: Ensure frame rate targets are met consistently

### Testing Scope
**In Scope:**
- Core game mechanics (movement, collision, scoring, growth)
- User interface and navigation
- Canvas rendering and performance
- Keyboard input handling
- Responsive design and mobile compatibility
- Browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

**Out of Scope:**
- Automated unit testing (personal project simplification)
- Load testing (single-user application)
- Security testing (no user data or authentication)
- Accessibility automation (manual checks sufficient)

## Testing Types and Coverage

### 1. Functional Testing

#### Core Game Mechanics Testing
**Snake Movement:**
- [ ] Snake moves smoothly in all four directions using arrow keys
- [ ] Snake moves smoothly in all four directions using WASD keys
- [ ] Snake cannot reverse directly into its own body
- [ ] Snake continues moving in current direction when no input provided
- [ ] Direction changes are responsive (< 100ms response time)
- [ ] Rapid direction changes handled correctly without input loss

**Food System:**
- [ ] Food appears on game board at game start
- [ ] Food spawns randomly after consumption
- [ ] Food never spawns on snake body segments
- [ ] Snake grows by one segment when consuming food
- [ ] Score increases by 10 points per food consumed
- [ ] New food appears immediately after consumption (< 100ms)

**Collision Detection:**
- [ ] Game ends when snake hits top boundary
- [ ] Game ends when snake hits bottom boundary  
- [ ] Game ends when snake hits left boundary
- [ ] Game ends when snake hits right boundary
- [ ] Game ends when snake head collides with body segment
- [ ] Collision detection is pixel-accurate
- [ ] No false positive collisions occur

**Scoring System:**
- [ ] Score starts at 0 for new games
- [ ] Score increases correctly for each food consumed
- [ ] Score display updates immediately upon point gain
- [ ] Score persists during pause/resume cycles
- [ ] Score resets correctly when starting new game

#### User Interface Testing
**Navigation:**
- [ ] Main menu displays all navigation options clearly
- [ ] "Play Game" button navigates to game page
- [ ] "High Scores" button navigates to scores page  
- [ ] "Settings" button navigates to settings page
- [ ] Back navigation works from all pages
- [ ] Browser back/forward buttons work correctly

**Game Controls:**
- [ ] Start game button initiates new game
- [ ] Pause button stops game movement immediately
- [ ] Resume button continues from exact pause state
- [ ] Restart button resets game to initial state
- [ ] Spacebar toggles pause/resume correctly
- [ ] Game over screen shows final score
- [ ] Game over screen provides restart and menu options

### 2. Performance Testing
