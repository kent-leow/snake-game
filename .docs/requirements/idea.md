A classic snake game with new game mechanism.
Introduce combo, having 5 food blocks at the same time, one eaten another will come out.
food block has number tagged.
Snake eat with order has extra point.
Point: eat one block = 10pts, one combo = 5pts.
Snake growth = speed and length
speed increase every combo, combo break back to normal speed.
length increase one block every 100pts
