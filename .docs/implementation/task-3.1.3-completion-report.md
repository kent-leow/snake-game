## Acceptance Criteria Validation

### âœ… AC1: Mobile Device Responsiveness
**GIVEN** mobile device **WHEN** viewing **THEN** page is responsive and readable on small screens

**Implementation Validation:**
- âœ… Mobile-first CSS approach ensures optimal small screen performance
- âœ… Card layout provides better readability on mobile devices
- âœ… Touch-optimized spacing and target sizes (minimum 44px)
- âœ… Viewport meta tag handling for proper mobile rendering
- âœ… Text remains legible with proper contrast ratios
- âœ… Content fits within viewport without horizontal scrolling

**Test Coverage:**
- Mobile layout rendering tests (375px viewport)
- Touch device detection and optimization
- Portrait/landscape orientation handling
- Content readability validation

### âœ… AC2: Table Layout Adaptation
**GIVEN** mobile viewing **WHEN** active **THEN** table layout adapts appropriately to screen size

**Implementation Validation:**
- âœ… Desktop table layout hidden on mobile devices
- âœ… Card layout displayed on mobile/tablet (< 1024px)
- âœ… Smooth transition between layout modes
- âœ… All data remains accessible in both layouts
- âœ… Responsive breakpoints properly configured
- âœ… CSS Grid and Flexbox ensure proper adaptation

**Layout Behavior:**
- **Mobile (< 768px)**: Single-column card stack
- **Tablet (768px - 1023px)**: Two-column card grid
- **Desktop (1024px+)**: Six-column table layout

**Test Coverage:**
- Viewport-specific layout rendering
- Breakpoint transition testing
- Data preservation across layouts
- CSS class application verification

### âœ… AC3: Score Formatting and Readability
**GIVEN** score formatting **WHEN** displayed **THEN** numbers are clearly readable and properly formatted

**Implementation Validation:**
- âœ… Number formatting with thousands separators (e.g., "15,000")
- âœ… Consistent typography across all viewport sizes
- âœ… Color-coded metrics for better visual hierarchy
- âœ… Proper font sizes and weights for readability
- âœ… High contrast color scheme for accessibility
- âœ… Responsive font scaling for different screen sizes

**Formatting Features:**
- Score values: Localized number formatting with commas
- Time values: MM:SS format for game duration
- Rank display: Medal emojis (ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥ˆðŸ¥‰) for top 3, numbers for others
- Date formatting: Localized date display
- Color coding: Green for scores, purple for combos, blue for time

**Test Coverage:**
- Number formatting validation
- Typography consistency testing
- Color contrast verification
- Cross-device readability testing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Responsive Breakpoints
```css
/* Mobile First Approach */
/* Default: Mobile (320px - 767px) */
/* Tablet: 768px - 1023px */
/* Desktop: 1024px+ */
```

### Hook Architecture
```typescript
interface ResponsiveHookResult {
  viewMode: 'mobile' | 'tablet' | 'desktop';
  isMobile: boolean;
  isTablet: boolean;
  isDesktop: boolean;
  screenWidth: number;
  screenHeight: number;
  orientation: 'portrait' | 'landscape';
  isTouch: boolean;
  prefersReducedMotion: boolean;
}
```

### CSS Module Classes
- Layout containers: `.scoreContainer`, `.scoreTable`, `.scoreCards`
- Component styles: `.scoreCard`, `.tableRow`, `.cardHeader`
- Responsive utilities: Breakpoint-specific styling
- Accessibility: Reduced motion, high contrast support
