# User Story: Progressive Speed Mechanics

## Story Header
- **ID**: US-2.3
- **Title**: Progressive Speed Mechanics
- **Phase**: phase-2
- **Priority**: high
- **Size**: M
- **Source Requirements**: [FR-008, FR-009]

## Story
**As a** Sam (strategy player)  
**I want** the snake to move faster after each combo but return to normal speed when I break a combo  
**So that** I experience increasing challenge that rewards skill while providing recovery opportunities

## Context
Speed progression mechanics create dynamic difficulty that increases with successful combo completion but resets on failure, balancing challenge escalation with recovery opportunities for continued play.

## Role
Sam represents strategy players who enjoy escalating challenges that test their skill while providing fair recovery mechanisms.

## Functionality
- Snake speed increases incrementally after each completed combo
- Speed resets to base level when combo sequence is broken
- Visual indicator shows current speed level
- Speed progression creates noticeable but manageable difficulty increase
- Maximum speed cap prevents unplayable difficulty

## Business Value
Adds dynamic difficulty progression that keeps gameplay challenging and engaging while providing clear consequences for both success and failure in combo execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional
- GIVEN combo completed WHEN sequence 1→2→3→4→5 finishes THEN snake speed increases by one increment
- GIVEN combo broken WHEN wrong food eaten THEN snake speed resets to base level immediately
- GIVEN speed increases WHEN multiple combos completed THEN each combo adds one speed increment
- GIVEN maximum speed WHEN reached THEN speed increases stop at defined cap
- GIVEN speed changes WHEN occurring THEN game maintains playable control responsiveness

### Non-Functional
- GIVEN speed increase WHEN applied THEN change takes effect within 100ms of combo completion
- GIVEN speed reset WHEN triggered THEN returns to base speed within 100ms of combo break
- GIVEN faster speeds WHEN active THEN game maintains minimum 30 FPS performance
- GIVEN speed progression WHEN running THEN control responsiveness remains consistent

### UI/UX
- GIVEN speed changes WHEN occurring THEN visual indicator shows current speed level
- GIVEN speed increase WHEN happening THEN smooth transition prevents jarring gameplay
- GIVEN current speed WHEN displayed THEN player can see their current speed level
- GIVEN speed progression WHEN active THEN difficulty feels challenging but fair

## Metadata

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Speed increases by defined increment after each completed combo
- [ ] Speed resets to base level when combo is broken
- [ ] Visual speed indicator shows current speed level to player
- [ ] Speed progression has reasonable maximum cap
- [ ] Speed transitions are smooth and maintain control responsiveness
- [ ] Speed changes integrate seamlessly with existing movement system
- [ ] Performance remains stable at higher speeds
- [ ] Speed mechanics feel balanced and fair during gameplay

### Technical Notes
- Modify game loop timing to handle variable snake movement speed
- Implement speed state management linked to combo system
- Design speed progression curve that remains playable
- Create visual indicator component for current speed display
- Consider using smooth interpolation for speed transitions
- Set reasonable maximum speed to maintain playability

### Test Scenarios
- Complete combo and verify speed increases appropriately
- Break combo and verify speed immediately resets to base level
- Complete multiple combos and verify cumulative speed increases
- Test maximum speed cap prevents unplayable speeds
- Verify control responsiveness remains good at higher speeds
- Test speed transitions feel smooth and natural during gameplay

### Dependencies
- US-2.2 (Order-Based Combo System)
- US-1.3 (Basic Snake Movement)
