# User Story: Multiple Numbered Food Blocks

## Story Header

- **ID**: US-2.1
- **Title**: Multiple Numbered Food Blocks
- **Phase**: phase-2
- **Priority**: high
- **Size**: M
- **Source Requirements**: [FR-004]

## Story

**As a** Sam (strategy player)  
**I want** to see 5 numbered food blocks (1-5) simultaneously on the game board  
**So that** I can plan strategic moves and work toward achieving combos

## Context

This story introduces the unique mechanic that differentiates this snake game from classic versions. Having 5 numbered food blocks visible simultaneously enables strategic gameplay and sets up the combo system.

## Role

Sam represents strategy players who enjoy planning ahead and optimizing their gameplay for maximum scores.

## Functionality

- Display 5 food blocks simultaneously with numbers 1-5
- Each food block has clear, visible numbering
- Food blocks spawn in different colors or visual styles for easy identification
- New numbered food appears immediately when one is consumed
- Food blocks never overlap with snake or each other

## Business Value

Creates the foundation for strategic gameplay that differentiates this game from basic snake games, providing depth and replay value for strategy-oriented players.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional

- GIVEN game starts WHEN board initializes THEN exactly 5 food blocks appear with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- GIVEN food block consumed WHEN eaten by snake THEN new food block appears with the same number at different location
- GIVEN food blocks WHEN spawning THEN none appear on snake body segments
- GIVEN food blocks WHEN spawning THEN none overlap with other food blocks
- GIVEN food blocks WHEN displayed THEN each number (1-5) is clearly visible and distinct

### Non-Functional

- GIVEN multiple food blocks WHEN rendering THEN performance maintains 60 FPS on desktop
- GIVEN food block consumption WHEN occurring THEN new food spawns within 100ms
- GIVEN food block display WHEN viewing THEN numbers are readable on all screen sizes
- GIVEN 5 food blocks WHEN checking collisions THEN detection remains accurate for all blocks

### UI/UX

- GIVEN numbered food blocks WHEN displayed THEN each number is clearly readable
- GIVEN food blocks WHEN rendered THEN distinct visual styling makes them easily identifiable
- GIVEN mobile viewing WHEN displaying THEN food block numbers remain legible on small screens
- GIVEN food blocks WHEN present THEN color or styling helps distinguish from snake and background

## Metadata

### Definition of Done

- [ ] 5 food blocks render simultaneously with visible numbers 1-5
- [ ] Food blocks use distinct visual styling for easy identification
- [ ] New food blocks spawn immediately when consumed
- [ ] Food blocks never overlap with snake or each other
- [ ] Numbers are clearly readable on all screen sizes
- [ ] Performance remains smooth with multiple food blocks
- [ ] Visual design supports strategic gameplay planning
- [ ] Food block spawning logic prevents invalid positions

### Technical Notes

- Extend food spawning system to handle multiple simultaneous food blocks
- Implement collision detection for multiple food items
- Use clear visual design with contrasting colors for numbers
- Consider using different background colors or borders for each numbered block
- Ensure font size scales appropriately for mobile devices
- Optimize rendering for multiple food items

### Test Scenarios

- Start game and verify exactly 5 numbered food blocks appear
- Consume each numbered food block and verify replacement spawns correctly
- Verify no food blocks overlap with snake or each other during spawning
- Test visual clarity of numbers on different screen sizes and devices
- Verify performance remains smooth with 5 simultaneous food blocks
- Test edge cases where limited spawn space is available

### Dependencies

- US-1.4 (Food Consumption and Snake Growth)
- US-1.7 (Canvas-Based Game Rendering)

### Generated Tasks

- T-2.1.1: Implement Multiple Food Block System
- T-2.1.2: Implement Food Block Visual Design
