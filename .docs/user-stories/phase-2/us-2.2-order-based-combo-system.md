## Story
**As a** Sam (strategy player)  
**I want** to earn bonus points by eating numbered food blocks in sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  
**So that** I can achieve higher scores through strategic gameplay planning

## Context
The core innovation of this snake game is the combo system where players earn bonus points for eating numbered food blocks in the correct sequence. This creates strategic depth and rewards planning ahead.

## Role
Sam represents strategy players who enjoy games with depth, optimization opportunities, and skill-based scoring systems.

## Functionality
- Track sequence of food blocks consumed
- Award combo bonus when sequence 1→2→3→4→5 is completed
- Reset combo progress when wrong number is eaten
- Display current combo progress to player
- Provide visual feedback for combo achievements and breaks

## Business Value
Creates the primary differentiating feature that makes this game unique and engaging for strategy players, driving replay value and skill development.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional
- GIVEN player eats food blocks in sequence 1→2→3→4→5 WHEN sequence completes THEN combo bonus of 5 points is awarded
- GIVEN player eating food blocks in correct sequence WHEN next correct number eaten THEN combo progress advances
- GIVEN player eating food blocks WHEN wrong number in sequence eaten THEN combo progress resets to 0
- GIVEN combo completion WHEN achieved THEN new combo tracking begins immediately
- GIVEN combo progress WHEN tracking THEN current progress displays to player
- GIVEN combo achieved WHEN completed THEN total score includes base points (10) plus combo bonus (5)

### Non-Functional
- GIVEN combo calculation WHEN processing THEN score updates within 50ms of food consumption
- GIVEN combo tracking WHEN running THEN system maintains accurate sequence state
- GIVEN combo visual feedback WHEN displayed THEN updates smoothly without lag
- GIVEN combo system WHEN active THEN no performance impact on game responsiveness

### UI/UX
- GIVEN combo progress WHEN advancing THEN visual indicator shows current position in sequence
- GIVEN combo completion WHEN achieved THEN celebratory visual feedback displays
- GIVEN combo break WHEN occurring THEN clear feedback indicates sequence reset
