# User Story: High Score Persistence

## Story Header

- **ID**: US-2.4
- **Title**: High Score Persistence
- **Phase**: phase-2
- **Priority**: high
- **Size**: M
- **Source Requirements**: [FR-027]

## Story

**As a** Sam (strategy player)  
**I want** my high scores to be saved and persist between game sessions  
**So that** I can track my progress and have motivation to improve my performance

## Context

Score persistence enables players to track their achievements over time, providing motivation for continued play and improvement. This requires database integration and API endpoints for score management.

## Role

Sam represents strategy players who are motivated by progress tracking and personal achievement records.

## Functionality

- Save scores to MongoDB database when game ends
- Retrieve and display personal high scores
- Persistent storage survives browser sessions and device changes
- API endpoints for score management
- Optional player name entry for score records

## Business Value

Increases player engagement and retention by providing persistent progress tracking and motivation to achieve higher scores over multiple sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional

- GIVEN game over WHEN score achieved THEN score is automatically saved to database
- GIVEN score saving WHEN attempted THEN player can optionally enter name for record
- GIVEN high scores WHEN viewing THEN personal best scores display in descending order
- GIVEN database unavailable WHEN saving THEN score is stored locally as fallback
- GIVEN multiple sessions WHEN playing THEN scores persist across browser restarts
- GIVEN API endpoints WHEN accessed THEN scores can be retrieved and saved successfully

### Non-Functional

- GIVEN score saving WHEN triggered THEN operation completes within 2 seconds
- GIVEN high score retrieval WHEN requested THEN data loads within 3 seconds
- GIVEN database connection WHEN lost THEN graceful fallback to local storage occurs
- GIVEN concurrent users WHEN saving scores THEN database handles multiple simultaneous saves

### UI/UX

- GIVEN game over WHEN occurring THEN option to save score with name is clearly presented
- GIVEN high scores WHEN displayed THEN scores are formatted clearly with date/time
- GIVEN score saving WHEN in progress THEN loading indicator shows operation status
- GIVEN network issues WHEN encountered THEN user receives clear feedback about save status

## Metadata

### Definition of Done

- [ ] MongoDB schema designed for score storage
- [ ] API endpoints created for score saving and retrieval
- [ ] Score saving triggers automatically on game over
- [ ] High score display page shows personal bests
- [ ] Local storage fallback implemented for offline scenarios
- [ ] Optional player name entry for score records
- [ ] Proper error handling for database connectivity issues
- [ ] Score data includes timestamp and relevant game statistics

### Technical Notes

- Design MongoDB schema with fields for score, playerName, timestamp, comboCount
- Implement Next.js API routes for score management
- Use Mongoose ODM for type-safe database operations
- Add error handling and retry logic for network issues
- Consider implementing score validation to prevent cheating
- Use local storage as fallback when database is unavailable

### Test Scenarios

- Complete game and verify score saves to database with optional name
- View high scores page and verify scores display correctly
- Test score persistence across browser sessions and page refreshes
- Simulate network issues and verify local storage fallback works
- Test API endpoints directly for score saving and retrieval
- Verify score data includes all relevant information (score, name, timestamp)

### Dependencies

- US-1.1 (Project Foundation Setup)
- US-2.2 (Order-Based Combo System)
- US-1.5 (Collision Detection and Game Over)

### Generated Tasks

- T-2.4.1: Design MongoDB Score Schema
- T-2.4.2: Implement Score API Endpoints
- T-2.4.3: Implement Client-Side Score Management
