- GIVEN audio volume controls WHEN adjusted THEN sound effects volume changes accordingly
- GIVEN mute enabled WHEN activated THEN all sound effects are silenced

### Non-Functional
- GIVEN sound effects WHEN triggered THEN play within 50ms of game event
- GIVEN multiple sounds WHEN overlapping THEN audio system handles simultaneous playback
- GIVEN sound effects WHEN playing THEN no impact on game performance

### UI/UX
- GIVEN eating sound WHEN played THEN provides satisfying feedback for successful action
- GIVEN combo sound WHEN played THEN celebratory tone indicates achievement
- GIVEN game over sound WHEN played THEN appropriate tone indicates failure
