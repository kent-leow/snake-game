# User Story: Production Deployment

## Story Header
- **ID**: US-3.2
- **Title**: Production Deployment
- **Phase**: phase-3
- **Priority**: critical
- **Size**: M
- **Source Requirements**: [FR-026]

## Story
**As a** developer  
**I want** to deploy the game to Vercel with MongoDB Atlas integration  
**So that** users can access the game from anywhere on the web

## Context
Production deployment makes the game accessible to users worldwide and establishes the production infrastructure needed for ongoing gameplay and score persistence.

## Role
Developer perspective focused on making the game publicly accessible with proper production infrastructure.

## Functionality
- Vercel deployment configuration
- MongoDB Atlas integration for production database
- Environment variable management
- Production build optimization
- Health checks and monitoring setup

## Business Value
Makes the game publicly accessible and establishes production infrastructure for real user engagement and score tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional
- GIVEN production deployment WHEN accessing public URL THEN game loads and functions correctly
- GIVEN production environment WHEN users play THEN scores save to MongoDB Atlas successfully
- GIVEN production build WHEN deployed THEN all game features work identically to development
- GIVEN environment variables WHEN configured THEN production database connectivity works
- GIVEN deployment pipeline WHEN triggered THEN updates deploy automatically from main branch

### Non-Functional
- GIVEN production game WHEN loading THEN initial load completes within 5 seconds
- GIVEN production environment WHEN accessed THEN maintains 99% uptime
- GIVEN production deployment WHEN running THEN handles concurrent users effectively
- GIVEN production database WHEN accessed THEN responds within 2 seconds for score operations

### UI/UX
- GIVEN production URL WHEN accessed THEN game is fully functional and responsive
- GIVEN production environment WHEN used THEN user experience matches development environment
- GIVEN mobile devices WHEN accessing production THEN game works correctly across different devices
- GIVEN production game WHEN played THEN performance is smooth and responsive

## Metadata

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Vercel project configured and connected to GitHub repository
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas cluster created and configured
- [ ] Environment variables set up for production database connection
- [ ] Production build deploys successfully without errors
- [ ] All game features function correctly in production
- [ ] Score persistence works with MongoDB Atlas
- [ ] Production URL is accessible and game loads properly
- [ ] Performance meets specified requirements in production

### Technical Notes
- Configure Vercel project with Next.js build settings
- Set up MongoDB Atlas cluster with appropriate access controls
- Configure environment variables for production database connection
- Test deployment pipeline with GitHub integration
- Implement production-specific optimizations
- Set up monitoring and error tracking

### Test Scenarios
- Deploy to production and verify game loads and functions correctly
- Test score saving and retrieval in production environment
- Verify all pages and navigation work in production
- Test game performance and responsiveness in production
- Confirm MongoDB Atlas connectivity and data persistence
- Test deployment pipeline by pushing changes to main branch

### Dependencies
- US-2.4 (High Score Persistence)
- US-1.1 (Project Foundation Setup)
