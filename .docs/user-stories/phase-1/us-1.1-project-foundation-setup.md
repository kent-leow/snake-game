# User Story: Project Foundation Setup

## Story Header

- **ID**: US-1.1
- **Title**: Project Foundation Setup
- **Phase**: phase-1
- **Priority**: critical
- **Size**: M
- **Source Requirements**: [FR-015, FR-016]

## Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** to set up the Next.js project with TypeScript and Docker MongoDB configuration  
**So that** I have a solid foundation for building the snake game with proper development infrastructure

## Context

This story establishes the technical foundation for the entire project, including the Next.js framework setup, TypeScript configuration, MongoDB Docker setup, and initial project structure that will support all subsequent development phases.

## Role

Developer setting up project infrastructure

## Functionality

- Next.js 14+ project initialization with TypeScript strict mode
- Docker MongoDB container configuration for local development
- Basic project structure following stack conventions
- Development environment setup and validation

## Business Value

Provides the essential technical foundation that enables all subsequent game features to be built efficiently with type safety and proper data persistence infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional

- GIVEN development environment WHEN project is initialized THEN Next.js 14+ with TypeScript is configured
- GIVEN project setup WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN no errors occur with strict mode enabled
- GIVEN Docker setup WHEN MongoDB container starts THEN database connection succeeds
- GIVEN project structure WHEN examining folders THEN follows Next.js conventions (app/, components/, lib/, etc.)
- GIVEN development server WHEN started THEN application loads without errors

### Non-Functional

- GIVEN development environment WHEN project builds THEN compilation completes within 30 seconds
- GIVEN Docker container WHEN MongoDB starts THEN connects within 10 seconds
- GIVEN TypeScript strict mode WHEN enabled THEN all type checking passes
- GIVEN project dependencies WHEN installed THEN no security vulnerabilities reported

### UI/UX

- GIVEN development server WHEN accessing localhost THEN Next.js welcome page displays
- GIVEN error scenarios WHEN they occur THEN clear error messages show in console
- GIVEN hot reload WHEN code changes THEN updates reflect within 2 seconds

## Metadata

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Next.js project created with TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] Docker Compose file configured for MongoDB
- [ ] Package.json includes all necessary dependencies
- [ ] Project structure follows Next.js conventions
- [ ] Development server runs without errors
- [ ] MongoDB connection established and tested
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes with strict mode
- [ ] Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore

### Technical Notes

- Use Next.js app directory structure for better organization
- Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Set up environment variables for MongoDB connection
- Include Docker Compose for consistent development environment
- Consider using Mongoose ODM for type-safe database operations

### Test Scenarios

- Fresh project setup on new development machine
- MongoDB container restart and reconnection
- TypeScript compilation with various code samples
- Development server startup and hot reload functionality
- Environment variable configuration and validation

### Dependencies

- None (foundational story)

### Implementation Tasks

- **T-1.1.1**: Next.js TypeScript Project Setup
- **T-1.1.2**: MongoDB Docker Configuration
- **T-1.1.3**: Development Environment and Tooling
