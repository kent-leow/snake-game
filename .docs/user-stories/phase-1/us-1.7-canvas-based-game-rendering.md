# User Story: Canvas-Based Game Rendering

## Story Header
- **ID**: US-1.7
- **Title**: Canvas-Based Game Rendering
- **Phase**: phase-1
- **Priority**: critical
- **Size**: M
- **Source Requirements**: [FR-022]

## Story
**As a** Alex (casual gamer)  
**I want** to see smooth visual rendering of the game on a canvas  
**So that** I have a clear, responsive visual experience while playing

## Context
The visual foundation of the game requires a well-implemented Canvas-based rendering system that provides smooth graphics, clear visual distinction between game elements, and responsive performance across devices.

## Role
Alex represents casual gamers who expect smooth, clear visuals that enhance rather than detract from gameplay.

## Functionality
- HTML5 Canvas element for game rendering
- Clear visual distinction between snake, food, and game board
- Smooth rendering loop synchronized with game logic
- Responsive canvas sizing for different screen sizes
- Clean, readable visual design

## Business Value
Provides the visual foundation that makes the game engaging and playable, ensuring users can clearly see and interact with all game elements.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional
- GIVEN game page loads WHEN canvas renders THEN game board displays with clear boundaries
- GIVEN snake moves WHEN rendering updates THEN snake segments display distinctly
- GIVEN food appears WHEN rendering updates THEN food is clearly visible and distinct from snake
- GIVEN game state changes WHEN rendering occurs THEN visual updates reflect current state immediately
- GIVEN canvas size WHEN window resizes THEN game maintains proper proportions

### Non-Functional
- GIVEN game running WHEN rendering THEN maintains 60 FPS on desktop devices
- GIVEN game running WHEN rendering THEN maintains 30 FPS minimum on mobile devices
- GIVEN canvas operations WHEN performing THEN no memory leaks occur during extended play
- GIVEN visual updates WHEN occurring THEN remain smooth without stuttering or lag

### UI/UX
- GIVEN game elements WHEN displayed THEN snake head is visually distinct from body segments
- GIVEN game board WHEN rendered THEN boundaries are clearly defined
- GIVEN food items WHEN displayed THEN easily distinguishable from snake and background
- GIVEN mobile device WHEN viewing THEN canvas scales appropriately to screen size

## Metadata

### Definition of Done
- [ ] HTML5 Canvas element integrated into game page
- [ ] Rendering loop implemented with requestAnimationFrame
- [ ] Snake renders with distinct head and body segments
- [ ] Food renders clearly and distinctly
- [ ] Game board boundaries are visible
- [ ] Canvas is responsive to different screen sizes
- [ ] Performance meets frame rate requirements
- [ ] Visual design is clean and readable

### Technical Notes
- Use HTML5 Canvas API for all game rendering
- Implement rendering loop separate from game logic loop
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
- Consider using offscreen canvas for performance optimization
- Implement responsive canvas sizing with CSS and JavaScript
- Use clear color schemes for accessibility

### Test Scenarios
- Verify canvas renders correctly on different screen sizes
- Test performance on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Confirm visual clarity of all game elements
- Test extended gameplay sessions for memory leaks
- Verify rendering remains smooth during fast gameplay
- Test canvas responsiveness when browser window is resized

### Dependencies
- US-1.1 (Project Foundation Setup)
- US-1.3 (Basic Snake Movement)
- US-1.4 (Food Consumption and Snake Growth)

### Implementation Tasks
- **T-1.7.1**: Canvas Rendering System
- **T-1.7.2**: Mobile-Responsive Game Interface
