## Story Header

- **ID**: US-1.6
- **Title**: Game Controls and State Management
- **Phase**: phase-1
- **Priority**: critical
- **Size**: S
- **Source Requirements**: [FR-016]

## Story

**As a** Alex (casual gamer)  
**I want** to start, pause, and restart the game easily  
**So that** I can control my gaming session and resume play when convenient

## Context

Players need essential game controls to manage their gaming experience, including the ability to start games, pause during play, and restart for new attempts. This provides necessary user control over game sessions.

## Role

Alex represents casual gamers who need simple, accessible controls to manage their gameplay sessions without confusion.

## Functionality

- Start game button to begin gameplay
- Pause/resume functionality during active games
- Restart game button to begin fresh session
- Clear visual indicators for current game state
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick access

## Business Value

Gives players control over their gaming experience, enabling convenient session management and encouraging longer engagement by allowing pause/resume functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional

- GIVEN main menu or game page WHEN user clicks "Start Game" THEN new game begins
- GIVEN active game WHEN user clicks "Pause" or presses spacebar THEN game pauses
- GIVEN paused game WHEN user clicks "Resume" or presses spacebar THEN game resumes
- GIVEN any game state WHEN user clicks "Restart" THEN game resets to beginning
- GIVEN paused state WHEN user pauses THEN snake movement stops immediately
- GIVEN resumed state WHEN user resumes THEN snake continues from exact pause position

### Non-Functional

- GIVEN control input WHEN button clicked THEN state change occurs within 100ms
- GIVEN pause action WHEN triggered THEN game state preserves completely
- GIVEN keyboard shortcuts WHEN used THEN respond equivalently to button clicks
- GIVEN state transitions WHEN occurring THEN no data loss or corruption happens

### UI/UX

- GIVEN game controls WHEN displayed THEN buttons are clearly labeled and visible
- GIVEN current state WHEN viewing THEN user can identify if game is running/paused
- GIVEN paused state WHEN active THEN clear indication shows game is paused
- GIVEN mobile device WHEN using controls THEN buttons are appropriately sized for touch

## Metadata

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Start Game button initiates new game session
- [ ] Pause/Resume button toggles game state during play
- [ ] Restart button resets game to initial state
- [ ] Spacebar keyboard shortcut for pause/resume
- [ ] Clear visual indicators for game states (running/paused)
- [ ] Controls work on both desktop and mobile
- [ ] Game state preservation during pause is complete
- [ ] UI clearly shows available actions based on current state

### Technical Notes

- Implement game state management (playing, paused, game-over, menu)
- Use keyboard event listeners for spacebar shortcut
- Ensure game loop can be paused and resumed cleanly
- Store complete game state for pause functionality
- Consider using React state or context for state management
- Design responsive button layout for mobile compatibility

### Test Scenarios

- Start new game and verify all game elements initialize correctly
- Pause game during play and verify snake stops moving immediately
- Resume paused game and verify continuation from exact pause state
- Test restart functionality resets score, snake position, and game board
- Verify keyboard shortcuts work equivalently to button clicks
- Test controls on mobile devices for touch responsiveness

### Dependencies

- US-1.3 (Basic Snake Movement)
- US-1.4 (Food Consumption and Snake Growth)
- US-1.5 (Collision Detection and Game Over)

### Implementation Tasks

- **T-1.6.1**: Game State Management System
- **T-1.6.2**: Game Control Interface and User Interaction
