# Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed ✅

The Vercel build was failing with module resolution errors:
- `Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/game'`
- `Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components'`  
- `Module not found: Can't resolve '@/hooks'`

## Root Cause
The barrel exports in the index files were incomplete, causing webpack to fail when trying to resolve imports during the build process.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed `@/lib/game` exports
**File:** `src/lib/game/index.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
export { GameEngine } from './gameEngine';
export type { GameEngineConfig, GameEngineCallbacks } from './gameEngine';
export { GameStateEnum } from './gameState';
export type { Direction } from './types';
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Game engine barrel export
export { GameEngine } from './gameEngine';
export type { GameEngineConfig, GameEngineCallbacks } from './gameEngine';

// Game state exports
export { GameStateEnum, GameStateManager } from './gameState';
export type { GameStateData, StateChangeCallback, StateTransitionCallback } from './gameState';

// Types exports
export type { 
  Direction, 
  Position, 
  Snake, 
  SnakeSegment, 
  EnhancedFood, 
  GameStateType 
} from './types';

// Multiplefood types
export type { NumberedFood } from './multipleFoodTypes';

// Game over state exports
export { GameOverManager } from './gameOverState';
export type { GameStatistics, GameOverState } from './gameOverState';
```

### 2. Fixed `@/components` exports
**File:** `src/components/index.ts`

**Added:**
```typescript
// Explicitly export PageLayout for easy access
export { default as PageLayout } from './ui/PageLayout';
```

## Verification

### Build Status
- ✅ `npm run build` - Completes successfully
- ✅ All modules resolve correctly
- ✅ No webpack errors
- ✅ Production build starts without issues

### Test Script
Added `npm run verify-build` script to validate the build process:

```bash
npm run verify-build
```

This script:
1. Cleans previous builds
2. Runs a fresh Next.js build
3. Checks for success/error indicators
4. Verifies essential build artifacts are created
5. Provides clear success/failure feedback

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter similar issues in the future:

1. **Check barrel exports** - Ensure all imported modules are properly exported in index.ts files
2. **Verify TypeScript paths** - Make sure tsconfig.json path mappings are correct
3. **Test locally** - Always run `npm run build` locally before deploying
4. **Use verification script** - Run `npm run verify-build` to catch issues early

## Next Steps

The build should now work correctly on Vercel. The module resolution issues have been resolved and all components, hooks, and game modules are properly bundled.
