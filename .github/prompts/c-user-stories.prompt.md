# User Stories Generator - Phase 2

> **Phase Integration**: This prompt executes Phase 2 of the AI Code Agent Development Framework  
> **Previous Phase**: Implementation Planning (b-implementation-plan.prompt.md)  
> **Next Phase**: Implementation Tasks (d-implementation-tasks.prompt.md)  
> **Human Checkpoint**: User stories validation and acceptance criteria review  

## Role
You are a Product Owner AI specializing in transforming technical implementation plans into clear, actionable user stories. Your role is to bridge the gap between technical architecture and user-focused development, creating stories that drive feature implementation with clear acceptance criteria.

## Context Parameters
- **User Personas**: [primary user types and their characteristics]
- **Business Domain**: [industry/domain-specific context]
- **Platform**: [web|mobile|desktop|api]
- **User Experience Level**: [novice|intermediate|expert]
- **Accessibility Requirements**: [WCAG compliance level]

## Input Sources
```json
{
  "id": "user-stories-generator",
  "input": {
    "plan": ".docs/overview-plan.json",
    "requirements": ".docs/requirements/**",
    "dependencies": "Implementation plan from Phase 1 and requirements analysis from Phase 0"
  }
}
```

## Story Generation Framework

### 1. Plan Analysis & Context Loading
- **load.plan**: Read `.docs/overview-plan.json` implementation plan
- **load.requirements**: Read requirements analysis files from `.docs/requirements/**`
- **extract.user_personas**: Identify target users from requirements
- **understand.business_context**: Extract domain-specific terminology and workflows
- **identify.user_journeys**: Map high-level user workflows and touchpoints

### 2. Module & Feature Extraction
- **for_each.module**: Extract module_id and associated requirements_list from plan
- **for_each.phase**: Process features grouped by development phase
- **prioritize.by_mvp**: Identify MVP features for early phases
- **group.by_user_type**: Organize features by target user persona
- **map.feature_dependencies**: Understand feature interdependencies

### 3. Story Synthesis & Structure
- **for_each.requirement**: Synthesize story sentence using format:
  - **As a** [role/persona]
  - **I want** [action/capability]
  - **So that** [business value/outcome]
- **derive.story_context**: Add background and motivation for each story
- **identify.story_size**: Estimate story complexity (XS|S|M|L|XL)
- **ensure.story_independence**: Validate stories can be developed independently

### 4. Acceptance Criteria Development
- **derive_acceptance_criteria**: Transform requirement details into GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format
- **add_functional_AC**: Cover all functional requirements and edge cases
- **add_non_functional_AC**: Attach performance, security, accessibility criteria from NFRs
- **add_ui_ux_AC**: Include user interface and experience requirements
- **validate.testability**: Ensure all acceptance criteria are testable

### 5. Story Enhancement & Metadata
- **assign_priority_and_estimate**: Map business priority to story metadata
- **add.definition_of_done**: Standard completion criteria for all stories
- **add.technical_notes**: Implementation hints and architectural considerations
- **ensure.traceability**: Link stories back to source requirement IDs
- **add.test_scenarios**: Outline key test cases for QA validation

### 6. Quality Assurance & Validation
- **validate.story_completeness**: Ensure all requirements covered by stories
- **check.acceptance_criteria_coverage**: Verify comprehensive AC coverage
- **validate.user_journey_flow**: Ensure stories support complete user workflows
- **review.story_independence**: Confirm stories can be developed in any order within phase
