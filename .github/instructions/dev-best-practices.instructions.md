# Dev Best Practices (Essentials)

Organization

- Follow structure; separate concerns; name clearly.

Version Control

- Small, tested commits with clear messages; document breaking changes.

Dependencies

- Minimize; pin versions; check CVEs; document why.

Testing

- Tests early; cover edges; mock externals; keep stable test data.

Docs

- Keep README/setup current; explain non‑obvious decisions.

Performance

- Profile before optimize; cache wisely; lazy‑load; watch resource use.
