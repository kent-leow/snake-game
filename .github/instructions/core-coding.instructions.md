# Core Coding (Concise)

Context First
- Read existing code and patterns; match conventions.
- Inspect deps and versions; respect constraints.

Quality
- Exact syntax; no silent failures; explicit errors.
- Comment nonâ€‘obvious logic; keep DRY and cohesive.

Validation
- Mentally test control flow and data shapes.
- Verify imports, types, and variable lifecycles.

Efficiency & Safety
- Choose proper data structures; avoid premature optimization.
- Validate and sanitize inputs; handle edge cases and errors.
