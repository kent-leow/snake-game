# Task Execution Framework

Analysis

- Break into atomic tasks; map deps; define success; estimate risk.

Planning

- Choose approach; map files/components; list tools; plan rollback.

Execution

- Start smallest step; validate each change; use right tools; keep clean state.

Verification

- Run tests; check regressions and errors; confirm requirements.

Communication

- State assumptions; ask only when blocked; report progress; explain tradeâ€‘offs.
